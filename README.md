- Gameplay element that uses Dot Product : 
	- Completed by Aisling D.
	- Tutorial & implementation followed as part of this video series : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQG9aUWarwE
	- Implementation used dot product to calculate if the player is within view cone element that is placed on the ghost enemies, and textured to look similar to the Gargoyle's flashlight. This is to try and give a similar visual representation of the cone of vision that will result in the player being captured.
- Gameplay Element that uses Linear Interpolation :
    - Completed by Isabella C.
    - Calculates the lerp between two quaternion transforms to rotate every gargoyle to face the player, making the gargoyles more of an immediate threat as they are not able to be avoided as easily.
- Particle Effect
    - Completed by Jasmine W. and Sam W
    - A spark particle effect was added to each of the lights within the level to give more ambience and personality to the visual effect of the lights flickering.
